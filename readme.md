# import [cosmogony](https://github.com/osm-without-borders/cosmogony/) into cities

Import cosmogony's cities into a postgresql database.
It's done to replace a legacy [navitia's "cities" module](https://github.com/CanalTP/navitia/tree/dev/source/cities).

Note: You need an up to date rust version.
